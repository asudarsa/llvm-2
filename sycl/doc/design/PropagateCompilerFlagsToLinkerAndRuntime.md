# Propagation of optimization levels used by front-end compiler to linker and backend compiler

In order to ease the process of debugging, there is a user requirement to compile different modules with different levels of optimization. This document proposes a compiler flow that will enable propagation of compiler options (limited to only optimization levels for now) specified for front-end to the linker and runtimes and eventually to the backend.

**NOTE**: This is not a final version. The document is still in progress.
